## Usage 🚀
To use the app, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Set up environment variables**: Create a `.env` file with your Google Client ID and Secret.
4. **Run the app**: `python app.py`
5. **Access the app**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

## Demo and Secure Deployment 🌐
You can try a demo of NoteUp by visiting [this link](https://noteup-jv4s.onrender.com).

For enhanced security, especially if you plan to enter important information, it is highly recommended to download the files and deploy the app locally or using a secure Flask deployment service such as Render.com or Heroku. This approach allows you to host a private version of your app, avoiding the need to share it with others. Note that this app is a concept and should not be deployed for general use, as important information may be at risk of exposure despite the security measures implemented, such as password and data encryption. Hosting the app locally or on your own server without sharing it is the best way to ensure your data remains secure.

## Adding Company Brands ➕
To add more companies to NoteUp, you need to update the following files:
1. **Company Info**: Modify all Python files in the `company_info` folder.
2. **Scripts**: Update `company-config.js` in the `scripts` folder.
3. **App Configuration**: If you want a company name to appear in all capital letters (like BBC, CNN, or UPS), modify the `app.py` file in the `@app.template_filter('capitalize_full')` section.

```python
@app.template_filter('capitalize_full')
def capitalize_full(name):
    # List of company names that should remain fully capitalized
    exceptions = ["CNN", "BBC", "BBVA", "ATT", "CNBC", "DELL", "HSBC", "ICICI", "UPS", "KPMG", "TATA", "SDU", "KTH"]
    ...
```

## Customization 🎨
You can customize NoteUp by:
- **Changing Profile Pictures**: Update the URLs in the `get_random_profile_picture` method in the `NoteUp` class.
- **UI Enhancements**: Modify HTML files in the `templates` folder and CSS/JS files in the `static` folder.

## Security Precautions 🔒

To ensure the security of user data, NoteUp implements several key precautions:

- **Password Encryption**: Instead of using SHA256 for password hashing, NoteUp uses `bcrypt`, a robust and secure method for hashing passwords. This enhances security by making it more difficult for attackers to crack passwords using brute force methods.

  ```python
  def encrypt_password(self, password):
      return bcrypt.generate_password_hash(password).decode('utf-8')
  
  def check_password(self, password, hashed):
      return bcrypt.check_password_hash(hashed, password)
  ```

- **Automatic Logout**: As an additional security measure, the app automatically logs out users after one minute of inactivity. This function helps prevent unauthorized access if a user leaves their session unattended. You can review the implementation of this feature in `inactivity.js` located in the `scripts` folder.

  ```javascript
  // inactivity.js
  let inactivityTime = function () {
    let time;
    // Automatically log out the user after 1 min of inactivity to enhance app security
    let maxInactivityTime = 1 * 60 * 1000; // 1 minute in milliseconds

    function logout() {
        window.location.href = "/timepass";
    }

    function resetTimer() {
        clearTimeout(time);
        time = setTimeout(logout, maxInactivityTime);
    }
  ```
